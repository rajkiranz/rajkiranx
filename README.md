## FunnyCoin Smart Contract Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `FunnyCoin` smart contract, which implements a basic ERC-20-like token on the Ethereum blockchain. 

**Important Note:** This is an educational example. **Do not** deploy this contract on a public blockchain without thorough testing and security audits. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to significant financial losses.

### Key Features

The `FunnyCoin` contract offers functionalities for creating and managing FC tokens:

* **Token Details:**
    * **Token Name:** FunnyCoin (Can be customized)
    * **Token Symbol:** FC (Can be customized)
    * **Total Supply:** Initially set to 1,000 tokens with 18 decimals (can be adjusted)
* **Balance Tracking:**
    * Uses a mapping to track the number of FC tokens held by each address.
* **Minting Functionality:**
    * The `mintFunnyCoin` function (not implemented in this example) would allow authorized users (e.g., contract owner) to increase the total supply and add tokens to a specified address's balance.

**Disclaimer:** 

This example focuses on the core functionalities of token creation and balance tracking. Minting functionality is not included for security reasons, as it requires careful considerations regarding access control and potential inflation. 

### Code Implementation

```solidity

// Import the ERC20 interface for compatibility
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract FunnyCoin is ERC20 {
    // Set the initial total supply of FunnyCoin tokens (can be adjusted)
    uint256 public constant TOTAL_SUPPLY = 1000 * 10**18; // 1000 tokens with 18 decimals

    // Constructor to initialize the total supply
    constructor() ERC20("FunnyCoin", "FC") {
        _mint(msg.sender, TOTAL_SUPPLY); // Mint the total supply to the deployer
    }
}
